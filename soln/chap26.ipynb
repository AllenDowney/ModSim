    "Since the record is 70 m, let's design a jump for 80 m. We'll start with\n",

    "\n",
    "-   Initially the bungee cord hangs from a crane with the attachment\n",
    "    point 80 m above a cup of tea.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Until the cord is fully extended, it applies no force to the jumper.\n",
    "    It turns out this might not be a good assumption; we will revisit\n",
    "    it.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   After the cord is fully extended, it obeys Hooke's Law; that is, it\n",
    "    applies a force to the jumper proportional to the extension of the\n",
    "    cord beyond its resting length. See <http://modsimpy.com/hooke>.\n",
    "\n",
